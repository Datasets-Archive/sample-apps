Sample app with FastAPI endpoint. RabbitMQ is used as a postman to deliver and return message between endpoint API and backend. Backend code could run on different microservice. Multiple backends can be started for scalability.

RabbitMQ logic is based on official example [Remote procedure call (RPC)](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-python.html)
